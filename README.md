## Introduction
Sarcasm detection is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) and can have applications in various fields such as sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and news aggregation.
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify news headlines as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The provided code implements a neural network approach using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging techniques like word embeddings and GlobalAveragePooling1D.
By utilizing this model, users can gain insights into the tone and sentiment of news articles, helping to identify sarcastic content and improve the overall understanding of news headlines.

## Dataset
Each record consists of three attributes:
- ```is_sarcastic```: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0
- ```headline```: the headline of the news article
- ```article_link```: link to the original news article. Useful for collecting supplementary data
